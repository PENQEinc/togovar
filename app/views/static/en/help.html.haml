        TogoVar in general

      %h3#g1
        Q. What are the objectives and utilities of TogoVar?
      %p
        A. NGS allowed genome sequencing, which was able to capture variants at low frequencies. However, existing
        databases in Western countries do not contain sufficient frequency data for Japanese populations. To address this
        problem, TogoVar seeks to provide a more reliable frequency information by assembling available information of
        genomic variation in Japanese individuals, as well as information from human databases that have been entrusted
        to the NBDC.
      %p
        In addition, since the reference human genome sequence is not always constant and can be updated, the genomic
        position may vary for the same variant if it refers to different sequences. Thus, in our database, a unique ID is
        assigned to the same variant, thereby preventing the need to convert the positional information of the variant
        among different reference sequences, as done by researchers.

      %h3#g2
        Q. Can I use TogoVar in-house?
      %p
        A. Docker images will be released. We request your patience.

      %h3#d1
        Q. Can I retrieve phenotype information on an individual level?
      %p
        A. Our database does not keep private information, and we do not currently provide phenotype information for each
        individual. For more details about phenotype information, please directly contact the research groups described in
        the

      %h3#d2
        Q. Are the data linked with information about gene expression and proteins?
      %p
        A. Our database has primarily integrated open information on Japanese subjects regarding their genetic variants
        in their genomes. Since our database uses RDF as the base technology, if there is a database that uses RDF to
        provide information about gene expression or proteins, we believe that our database can easily be extended to
        accommodate such information. An extension to the information about gene expression and proteins will be carried
        out in sequence.

        Duplication is classified as Insertion, and Indels, for which the lengths of Insertion and Deletion are the same,
        are classified as Substitution. To identify the type of the variant,

          Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)
        is used.

        Q. What are SIFT and PolyPhen?
      %p
        A. When an amino acid sequence undergoes alteration due to a variant, they predict the effects it has on the
        protein function. Values calculated through

        Q. What does the Frequency meter in the Frequency column of the search results represent?
      %p
        A. The Frequency meter represents the alternative allele frequency for each dataset. The color of the frequency
        meter corresponds to the color allocated to the dataset. The data availability or frequency value is represented
