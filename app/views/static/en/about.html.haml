      About TogoVar
    %p
      TogoVar (NBDC's integrated database of Japanese genomic variation) is a database that has collected and organized
      genome sequence differences between individuals (variants) in the Japanese population and disease information
      associated with them.

    %h2
      1. TogoVar provides variant frequencies in the Japanese population that have been aggregated across research
      projects
    %p
      It provides variant frequencies in the Japanese population (#{link_to 'JGA-NGS', doc_datasets_jga_ngs_path} and
      #{link_to 'JGA-SNP', doc_datasets_jga_snp_path}) obtained by aggregating individual genomic data that have been
      registered in #{humandb}/#{jga}.

    %h2
      2. TogoVar provides information in a one-stop, easy-to-understand manner by integrating scattered data
    %p
      It integrates information related to genotypes or phenotypes that has been compiled sporadically in a variety of
      different databases and provides information for interpreting variants in a one-stop, easy-to-understand manner.

    %h2
      Developers
    %p
      TogoVar has been developed as a joint research project of #{nbdc} and #{dbcls}.
