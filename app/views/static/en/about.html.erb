          TogoVar (NBDC's integrated database of Japanese genomic variation) is a database that has collected and
          organized
          genome sequence differences between individuals (variants) in the Japanese population and disease information
          associated with them.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          TogoVar provides variant frequencies in the Japanese population that have been aggregated across research
          projects. Two available datasets, <a href="/doc/datasets/jga_ngs">JGA-NGS</a> and
          <a href="/doc/datasets/jga_snp">JGA-SNP</a>, are obtained by aggregating individual genomic data that have
          been registered in <a target="_blank" href="https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/">the NBDC Human Database</a>
          /

            (JGA)</a>. In addition, TogoVar integrates
          <a href="/doc/datasets">information related to genotypes or phenotypes</a> that has been compiled
          independently in a variety of different databases and provides information for interpreting variants in a
          one-stop, easy-to-understand manner.
